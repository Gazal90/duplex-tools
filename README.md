# Read Fillet


### Installation

Read Fillet can be installed from PyPI with:

    pip install read_fillet

### Usage

Read Fillet is run simply with:

    read_fillet <fastq_directory> 

To see more options run:

    read_fillet --help

For each input fastq file found in the input directory, a file with an additional `_split` suffix will be output into the output directory, controlled by the `--output_dir` option. If not `--output_dir` is given then the output files are placed alongside in the input files.

The new `*_split.fastq` will contain two new reads for each read that was split, now with suffix `_1` and `_2`
Reads which were not split will also be added to the new file, so that `*_split.fastq` can be used as a match for any downstream analysis. For example the output may look like:

    @<read_id> <remaining_headers>
    <sequence>
    +
    <quality>
    @<read_id>_1 <remaining_headers>
    <sequence>
    +
    <quality>
    @<read_id>_2 <remaining_headers>
    <sequence>
    +
    <quality>

**Assessment**

An additional assessment program `read_fillet_assess` is available. This requires the addition dependencies: `pomoxis`, `samtools`, and `seqkit`. These are most easily obtained using conda (or mamba as a faster alternative):

    mamba create --name read_fillet -c bioconda seqkit samtools pomoxis python3.6
    conda activate read_fillet
    pip install read_fillet
