# Duplex Tools

Duplex Tools contains a set of utilities for dealing with Duplex sequencing
data. Tools are provided to identify and prepare duplex pairs for basecalling
by Guppy and for recovering simplex basecalls from incorrectly concatenated
pairs.

## Installation

Duplex Tools can be installed from PyPI with:

    pip install duplex_tools

## Usage

Duplex Tools is run simply with:

    duplex_tools --help

The available sub-commands are:

* [split_on_adapter](./fillet.md) - split incorrectly concantenate duplex pairs in to their component simplex reads (formerly `read_fillet`.
* pairs_from_summary - identify candidate duplex pairs from sequencing summary output by Guppy.
* filter_pairs - filter candidate pairs using basecall-to-basecall alignment.
